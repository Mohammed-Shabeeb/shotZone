Green goes short and outside off, there was deep backward point in place but it didn't matter to Hardik, he went for the upper cut and beat the fielder easily. The last over from Green was always going to be targeted and Hardik ensured India made the most of it"

His second in T20Is and both have come since he made his return to the team. Today the platform was set and he came and unleashed himself. This is a cracking shot to reach the landmark.

He was very deep in the crease. Ball tracking says out! Three reds. Smashing leg stump. Good review. Ellis strikes again.","Nathan Ellis to Karthik, out Lbw!! Excellent review from Ellis.
