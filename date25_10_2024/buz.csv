18.3,"Alzarri Joseph to Shivam Dube, SIX, high and mighty! Banged in short on middle, there's only one thing coming at Shivam Dube and he knows what it is, he sits back comfortably and nails the hook high and over the long leg ropes"

17.2,"Siraj to Shivam Dube, FOUR, 50-run stand comes up! This is just poor bowling, back of a length and on the hips, no one back at fine-leg and these are easy pickings for Dube as he tucks it away to the fine-leg fence"
17.1,"Siraj to Shivam Dube, no run, yorker goes horribly wrong but Siraj gets away with it, nearly a waist-high full-toss on middle, Shivam Dube was sitting back expecting a short one and he just bunted it towards cover"
16.6,"Alzarri Joseph to Shivam Dube, 1 run, good cricket again, good length delivery on off-stump, gently bunted towards mid-off for a quick single, even Faf isn't quick enough to stop the single"
16.5,"Alzarri Joseph to Shivam Dube, byes, FOUR, my my that went at pace! Back of a length on middle, this was bowled at full-throttle, Shivam Dube backed away a little looking to run it down but it whistled past his visor, kept rising on Anuj Rawat and he tipped it over with his fingertips as he leapt looking to stop it, RCB cannot afford these"
16.5,"Alzarri Joseph to Shivam Dube, wide, banged in short and going over the batter's head, that's both short deliveries allowed being wasted in wides"
16.4,"Alzarri Joseph to Shivam Dube, FOUR, expertly guided! RCB have telegraphed their intentions here, back of a length on off-stump, Shivam Dube hung back and stayed leg-side, let it come to him and just opened the face of the blade to steer it well to the left of third man"
16.4,"Alzarri Joseph to Shivam Dube, wide, RCB seem to be going a little overboard with the short stuff, Alzarri Joseph bangs it far too short, that was never even going to be close to Dube"

16.2,"Alzarri Joseph to Jadeja, 2 runs, excellent running agian, back of a length on middle, rushes Jadeja on the pull and it dribbles towards mid-wicket, Joseph runs to it himself but they're so quick between the wickets to pinch that second"
16.1,"Alzarri Joseph to Jadeja, 2 runs, length delivery just outside off, cut away towards deep point.

15.3,"Green to Shivam Dube, 3 runs, very clever batting, back of a length and outside off, Shivam Dube hung back and just opened the face of the blade to steer it up and over backward point, man running across to his right did really well to stop it with a dive but just pushed it too far back in, they get a third"
15.3,"Green to Shivam Dube, wide, banged in very short, that sailed over the batter and Shivam Dube is a fairly tall man"

13.6,"Maxwell to Shivam Dube, no run, flatter delivery and just pushed down leg, Shivam Dube looked to glance it fine and there was a loud appeal for caught behind, umpire stood unmoved so it might've brushed thigh pad"
13.5,"Maxwell to Shivam Dube, no run, flatter delivery just outside off, Shivam Dube presses back and cuts, backward point does well to stop it after tumbling to his left"

12.4,"Green to Jadeja, no run, good length delivery angling into the batter on off-stump, Jadeja has to get on his toes as he drops it into the off-side"
12.3,"Green to Mitchell, out Caught by Rajat Patidar!! The short-ball tactic finally pays off for RCB! Looks like RCB had a plan and they stuck with it. Banged into the deck on off-stump, Mitchell made a bit of room by backing away and looked to flat-bat this over long-on, didn't get nearly enough and it came off the top half. Went straight down Patidar's throat at long-on and another timely wicket for RCB. Mitchell c Rajat Patidar b Green 22(18) [6s-2]"
12.2,"Green to Shivam Dube, 1 run, in the air but safe! Again Green goes back of a length and into the body, cramps him for room as he looks to pull and lobs up, lands safely in the square leg region"
12.1,"Green to Shivam Dube, no run, nothing on UltraEdge, review lost!

10.2,"Green to Rahane, out Caught by Maxwell!! Superb catch from Maxwell in the deep! Rahane perishes but he's done his job. Back of a length on middle-leg again, didn't rise as much though and Rahane was hanging back again, he just checked his pull this time and it went off the top half, was still traveling but Maxwell intercepted it on the deep backward square leg ropes. He was a few yards in but did brilliantly to run to his left and jump at the right second to reel it in. Much needed for RCB, just keeps the morale up. Rahane c Maxwell b Green 27(19) [6s-2]"
10.1,"Green to Rahane, SIX, into the stands! Just back of a length on middle-leg, poor line again and Rahane seemingly was waiting for the short one, he was sitting back and pulled this away to the deep backward square leg with ease"
10.1,"Green to Rahane, wide, good length delivery that just angles down leg, Rahane looked to glance it fine and missed, called a wide"

8.1,"Karn Sharma to Mitchell, no run, tossed up full on off-stump, Mitchell prods forward and knocks it towards cover"
7.6,"Mayank Dagar to Rahane, no run, fired in quicker on a length, angles into the pads and skids through this time, beats Rahane who was looking to turn it into the leg-side and hits his pad, would've gone down leg"
7.5,"Mayank Dagar to Mitchell, 1 run, flatter delivery outside off, Mitchell shuffles across his stumps early and knocks it towards cover for a quick single, even a quick pick-up and throw from Faf can't find Rahane short"
