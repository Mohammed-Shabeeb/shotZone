18.4,4lb,"Alzarri Joseph to Dube, 4 leg byes 4 leg byes That's that! CSK's winning run against RCB at Fort Chepauk continues. There is a review, but more in desperation, I think. Aims for the yorker that hits Dube's pad and goes to the fine leg fence. Ball tracker confirms the ball pitched outside leg. Ruturaj Gaikwad has made a winning start to his captaincy tenure. See all photos"
18.3,6,"Alzarri Joseph to Dube,  SIX runs SIX runs TONKED! There was some aggression from Dube on that six. Banged in short outside off. He unleashes the pull and sends the ball soaring over deep backward square leg."

17.4,•,"Siraj to Dube, no run no run Low full toss outside off, he whacks it to extra cover. No run there"
17.3,•,"Siraj to Dube, no run no run Banged in short outside off, he misses his ramp as the ball goes to the keeper."

16.5,4b,"Alzarri Joseph to Dube, 4 byes 4 byes Beats the batter, beats the keeper and CSK collect four byes! That was banged in short at pace outside off. Dube looks for a ramp, misses as the ball hurries to Rawat who leaps with both hands up. The ball clips the tip of his fingers and runs away. Looks like he has hurt his fingers as well. Out comes the physio."

16.4,4,"Alzarri Joseph to Dube, FOUR runs FOUR runs Oh, that's so neatly done by Dube. Back of a length ball on off. Dube stays leg side of the ball and just helps it past point. Used the pace of the ball much to his advantage"
16.4,1w,"Alzarri Joseph to Dube, 1 wide 1 wide Banged in short and again that is quite short outside. A wide is a result"

16.2,2,"Alzarri Joseph to Jadeja,  2 runs 2 runs Banged in short at pace hurrying Jadeja who mistimes his pull towards long on. But because he had completely miscued it, the bowler had to sprint across. They take two."
16.1,2,"Alzarri Joseph to Jadeja,  2 runs 2 runs Back of a length ball outside off, he thrashes it away to deep point. Some confusion and the result is an over-throw. What happened is a throw was fired from the deep who hit direct at the striker's end. Rawat, meanwhile feels there is a chance of a run out at the non-striker's end. He lobs the ball, misses and there is no one backing up"

14.1,2,"Siraj to Jadeja,  2 runs 2 runs On a length on the pads of Jadeja who clips it to the right of deep square leg. The fielder does well to keep them down to two. Maxwell it was, who hared across"
13.6,•,"Maxwell to Dube, no run no run Huge appeal for caught behind but think that went off the pad. Not out says the umpire. Pushed quicker down leg, he looks to work it fine, can't get a bat on it. And the ball flicks his pad through to the keeper."

12.4,•,"Green to Jadeja, no run no run Length ball on off, he pushes towards point and was looking for a run. Is sent back."
12.3,W,"Green to Mitchell, OUT OUT The short ball does the trick for Green! Banged in short outside off, Mitchell was looking to go over long-on. Does not get any power on the pull and Patidar makes no mistake at long-on. See all photos"
12.2,1,"Green to Dube,  1 run 1 run Another miscue and the ball falls in no-man's land. Banged in short just above his hip. He mistimes his pull completely but the balls falls around the vacant square leg area"
12.1,•,"Green to Dube, no run no run Loud, loud appeal as Dube looks for a pull and gets beaten. But the umpire is unmoved. Faf has asked for a review. Don't think there was any bat there, though. Bouncer just outside off. He eyes the pull, is late again on it. Rawat was absolutely certain there was an edge. But replays confirm there was a gap between bat and ball."
11.6,2,"Alzarri Joseph to Mitchell,  2 runs 2 runs Slower short of a length ball on off stump. Mitchell waits for it and pulls in the gap between midwicket and long-on. They scurry back for two"

10.2,W,"Green to Rahane, OUT OUT Excellent catch by Maxwell at square leg and Rahane's sprightly knock ends. Back of a length ball but the line was crucial here. It was outside off, which meant Rahane had to fetch it and he could not control his pull. Maxwell is a few steps in from the boundary. But he adjusts well, and takes a reverse-cupped catch over his head See all photos"

6.6,W,"Karn to Ravindra, OUT OUT He's gone now! One shot too many for Rachin. Was a length ball on middle and leg. He sweeps eyeing another six, but doesn't connect as cleanly.

3.6,W,"Yash Dayal to Gaikwad, OUT OUT Edged and taken on the second attempt by Green at first slip. This is excellent bowling and also excellent captaincy from Faf to keep the slip in. Keeps it on a length but well outside off stump. Gaikwad gets forward reaching for the drive. He gets a thick edge and Green takes a fairly simple catch albeit on the second attempt.
