22.6,"Asalanka to Kuldeep, no run","ooh, turn for the first time in the over. A bit more flight outside off, and I think sometimes the line dictates how much overspin there is, because biomechanics, and Kuldeep goes back to defend, turns sharply to beat the outside edge"
23.1,"Theekshana to Sundar,  SIX runs","extraordinary timing. Full, anglingin towards off stump and he gets forward and launches it inside-out, effortlessly, for an 85m six over wide long-off"
23.2,"Theekshana to Sundar,  1 run","quickish, angling into middle stump this time, and he gets his front leg away from the line to drive inside-out and on the bounce to deep cover point"
23.3,"Theekshana to Kuldeep, no run","turns sharply as he slows this down wide of off, and it zips past the outside edge as Kuldeep pushes out to defend"
23.4,"Theekshana to Kuldeep, no run","quick turn from a length closer to off stump, gets forward to defend and it's past the edge once more"
23.5,"Theekshana to Kuldeep, no run","flat length ball close to off stump, gets a good stride in to defend with the turn, into the point region"
23.6,"Theekshana to Kuldeep,  1 run","full on middle stump, clipped to deep midwicket"
24.1,"Asalanka to Kuldeep, no run","nice flight on middle and off, straightens from there, gets forward to block it back to the bowler"
24.2,"Asalanka to Kuldeep,  1 run","top-edges as he looks to sweep a quick one from outside off. Gets a long way forward but not quite onto his back knee, so he doesn't have a stable base. Lands safely in front of deep backward square leg"
24.3,"Asalanka to Sundar, no run","goes on the back foot to defend one that skids on with the angle to beat the inside edge. Hits the back pad, but it's sliding down leg"
24.4,"Asalanka to Sundar, no run","down the track and Asalanka floats this up outside off. Drills a bottom-handed drive down the ground, and Theekshana throws himself to his right to stop it at mid-on"
24.5,"Asalanka to Sundar, no run","tossed up on middle and off, blocked back to the bowler"
24.6,"Asalanka to Sundar, no run","quick length ball on off stump, defended with soft hands to backward point"
25.1,"Theekshana to Kuldeep, no run","tossed up on the pads, and just defended by Kuldeep"
25.2,"Theekshana to Kuldeep,  1 run","full and straight again, gets forward and glances this fine to get Washington back on strike"
25.3,"Theekshana to Sundar, no run","good length, pitches middle and straightens. Washington makes room and plays this well away from the body. It's just a defensive push but has Theekshana with his head in his heads"
25.4,"Theekshana to Sundar, no run","Swing and a miss! Goes for the loft down the ground, but is beaten by the offbreak that turns away"
25.5,"Theekshana to Sundar, no run","back of a length wide of off, this has spun away and Sundar is reaching for it as he misses. Mendis is up straight away for a caught behind though! But no dice says Asalanka"
25.6,"Theekshana to Sundar, OUT","Sundar is gone! Is this finally the game? Looks to go over long-off and but ends up slicing it! It's high and Vandersay runs in to grab it. He bobbles it on the slide, but somehow holds on. The crowd knows what that wicket means"
26.1,"Wellalage to Kuldeep, OUT","and there's the fifth! And there is Sri Lanka's first bilateral ODI series win over India since August 1997! Tossed up, angling across, and it either skids on with the angle after pitching within the stumps or straightens ever so slightly. Goes hard at the sweep, and it turns in to beat him and strike his back leg. Given out, and India have no reviews left. Kuldeep was unlucky there. That didn't turn back enough to hit off stump, going by replays."
