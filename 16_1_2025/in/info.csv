19.2,4,"Arshdeep Singh to Karthik, FOUR runs FOUR runs Drilled down the ground, DK's reviving himself and takes RCB to a win in their first home game. Arshdeep went full and just outside off, Karthik got across and blasted it flat over the bowler. Too straight for long-on. Crowd are ecstatic See all photos"
19.2,1w,"Arshdeep Singh to Karthik, 1 wide 1 wide Wide and full. The angle takes it too far. DK leans and shapes to play but knows he doesn't have to. Gets the wide and the stumps' lights are doing their own dance"
19.1,6,"Arshdeep Singh to Karthik,  SIX runs SIX runs DK scoops the game back in RCB's favour. Whataguy! This was premeditated but to perfection. He was going square-on and the ball was into the pitch, angling outside off, he got behind it and launched it behind again. Short fine leg was in again, he outplayed a pacer. Again!"
18.6,1,"Harshal to Karthik,  1 run 1 run Goes back towards the yorker. Low fully though, at the stumps, worked to long-on"
18.5,6,"Harshal to Karthik,  SIX runs SIX runs Bumper sits up and DK hooks it over the fine-leg boundary! Slower one, 126ks, landed short, angled in to go over leg stump. Sat up for DK to get inside the line and launch it. Short fine leg was in, just a 59-metre hit. Brings the equation down to 11 off 7"
18.4,•,"Harshal to Karthik, no run no run Low fully hits pad, lbw not given. Harshal is interested, no review. 140ks, angling on leg, DK tries to clip behind square, gets opened up. Ball goes offside but nearby"
18.3,4,"Harshal to Karthik, FOUR runs FOUR runs Cannoned over the bowler. Hard length, 136ks, angling in towards fourth. Karthik didn't have to shift his line, got his weight forward and slapped it"
18.2,•,"Harshal to Karthik, no run no run Karthik starts backing away before coming back but Harshal, smartly bowls a Test ball to beat him. Three-quarter length on fifth, 140ks, Karthik was late on the attempted steer towards third. Beaten"
18.2,1w,"Harshal to Karthik, 1 wide 1 wide Angle works against Harshal this time. The full ball goes past the flick and down leg. Good stop by the keeper"
18.1,1,"Harshal to Lomror,  1 run 1 run It's full but not a yorker. Delivered from wide of the crease, angling towards fourth. Lomror was in the crease, drove it to long-off, along the ground"
17.6,1,"Arshdeep Singh to Lomror,  1 run 1 run Low full toss on middle, slipped with power but it's straight at square leg's shin."
17.5,•,"Arshdeep Singh to Lomror, no run no run Wide and full, outside Lomror's hitting arc. He's on one knee, but the stride is straight and not towards the line, tries to slash it over cover. Misses"
17.4,4,"Arshdeep Singh to Lomror, FOUR runs FOUR runs Speaker on, full volume! Short this time, around shoulder height, Lomror swivels and pulls. Didn't need to look at it, knew he'd get it over backward square"
17.3,6,"Arshdeep Singh to Lomror,  SIX runs SIX runs Slugged over cow corner! Slot ball angling in at off, 136ks, Lomror stays in the crease, twists his ankle inwards and launches it"
17.2,1,"Arshdeep Singh to Karthik,  1 run 1 run Pulls the shortish ball to deep square leg"
17.1,1b,"Arshdeep Singh to Lomror, 1 bye 1 bye Slower bouncer beats the pull, RCB get a bye though"
16.6,2,"Sam Curran to Karthik,  2 runs 2 runs Full and slow on leg, clipped to the right of Arshdeep at deep fine leg. DK scampers back for a tight second, makes it!"
16.5,4,"Sam Curran to Karthik, FOUR runs FOUR runs Down leg again. Back-of-length offcutter misses the line, it's helped off the top of the thighs. Four to fine leg"
16.4,1,"Sam Curran to Lomror,  1 run 1 run Harpreet Bhatia charges in from backward point as they go for the run, can't pick it up. It rolls back but they settle for one. Length outside off, was defended with an angled bat"
16.3,4,"Sam Curran to Lomror, FOUR runs FOUR runs Full and on the pads, drifting leg side and it's clipped wide of short fine for four"
16.2,W,"Sam Curran to Rawat, OUT OUT Slower one hits pad, that looked dead. Given too, Rawat reviews. Offcutter at 108ks, was the turn taking it too far? Impact seems to have been on middle and leg. Rawat was on the front foot and got hit under the knee roll after being beaten on the flick. Dhawan has a word with Curran while Hawk-Eye loads. That might not have been a cutter, almost looks like a back of handed. Chetan, our scorer, says it might be a googly. What does it say now? Clipping leg stump, decision stands."
16.1,•,"Sam Curran to Rawat, no run no run Full ball is pushed to mid-off"
