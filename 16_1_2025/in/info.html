So they won't allow me to hit gaps. Guys like KG and Arshdeep, if they are hitting length, you have to create momentum, once you're closer to the ball you negate the bounce. You have to come up with a game plan and try to keep improving. <b>I know my name is often used to just promote the T20 game across the world these days but still got it I guess</b>. [Last two months] We were not in the country. We were at a place where people weren't recognizing us. Just to feel normal for two months was a surreal experience. Of course, things become totally different with two kids from a family perspective. Just being together, the connection with the older kid too is amazing. I couldn't have been more grateful to God for the opportunity that I got to spend time with the family. I was telling the guys that the voices got that much louder as it wasn't the case for the last two months. It was amazing to be another person on the road. I don't play for caps, it's just another opportunity.

I know what this (orange cap) means. [Love story with the crowd] It's been going on for years. People talk a lot about playing the sport. At the end of the day you don't talk about the achievements, stats or numbers but the memories. It's what Rahul Dravid says. The friendship, love, appreciation, backing has been amazing and is what you'll miss and never forget. In T20, I'm opening, I try to give the team a blazing start. But when wickets start falling, you have to understand the conditions as well. The wicket wasn't as placid as normal here. It was a bit two-paced. Had to play correct cricketing shots, couldn't hit balls across the line. Tried a few, felt like I needed big hits at the other end, which didn't happen as Maxi and Anuj got out quickly. Disappointed not having finished it off. It was a slot ball that I sliced straight to deep point. Not a bad bad though playing after two months and getting into the tournament.

Gotta make sure you get over the line early in the tournament. Great to see the composure at the end. Don't think game was gone after Kohli went, because of the Impact Player and Mahipal in. In previous years we used to feel 12 runs in the last overs would be tough but now even 15s seem gettable in the last two. Really pleased for DK getting his game going. It sets us up for the rest of the tournament. Games get won at lost at the No. 7 and 8 position with the Impact subs, so he's key. Our plan at the auction was to find the DNA of the team. It's tough on this unique ground. The pitch was a bit different. Kohli's is still the same person, has had a nice break. It helps keep fresh in the back end of the career.</p></div><div class="ds-hover-child ds-ml-auto ds-mr-1"><div></div></div></div><div class="ds-hover-parent lg:hover:ds-bg-ui-fill-translucent ds-select-none lg:ds-select-auto ds-flex ds-items-start ds-relative"><div class="ds-grow"><p class="ci-html-content ds-py-2 ds-px-3 xl:ds-pr-14"><strong>Dinesh Karthik</strong> Getting there [past the rust] I wasn't completely in control but it started to feel good.

If you miss the dipping slower ball, you're done, so I had to time the scoop well. Lomror looked calm, didn't tell him anything at first.

Think we were 10-15 less. Should have encashed in the first six overs. We had to pay the price for dropping Kohli. We lost momentum there, it was crucial. It looked a good wicket but wasn't true. It was stopping, bit of double-bounce and turned. 70% it was coming good. I was happy with my runs but think could've played faster in the first six. We lost two wickets which put pressure too. That total we thought was par. Match went till last over, at the end we could have bowled better. Harpreet is bowling really well, that too to left-handers on a small ground.  He soaked in pressure and got breakthroughs. His celebration, the Kabaddi thing, is big in Punjab.

Kings were in it despite the unforced error. But Kohli gave RCB liftoff and DK landed the plane safely. All games this season have been won by the home team. RCB's record hasn't been great but that wasn't an issue tonight. The biggest event seemed to have taken place at the start of the chase, when Bairstow dropped Kohli. It unleashed one of the best players, and indeed flayers, in cricket. Him charging pacers and clubbing them through extra is what we've imagined doing as kids. The overseas stars failed. Promoting Green to No. 3 and Patidar over Maxwell didn't work. Harpreet was sensational, Rabada was good too. The constant wickets almost derailed the chase, especially Kohli fell due to some smart field placement. But DK came in with ice in the veins, got Lomror for support and the duo cleared the game with great skill and calmness.</p></div><div class="ds-hover-child ds-ml-auto ds-mr-1"><div></div></div></div><div class="ds-hover-parent lg:hover:ds-bg-ui-fill-translucent ds-select-none lg:ds-select-auto ds-flex ds-items-start ds-relative"><div class="ds-grow"><p class="ci-html-content ds-py-2 ds-px-3 xl:ds-pr-14">Raab: "As a Bangladeshi, just had PTSD watching DK bat like this.

The friendship, love, appreciation, backing has been amazing and is what you'll miss and never forget. In T20, I'm opening, I try to give the team a blazing start. But when wickets start falling, you have to understand the conditions as well. The wicket wasn't as placid as normal here. It was a bit two-paced. Had to play correct cricketing shots, couldn't hit balls across the line. Tried a few, felt like I needed big hits at the other end, which didn't happen as Maxi and Anuj got out quickly.

In previous years we used to feel 12 runs in the last overs would be tough but now even 15s seem gettable in the last two. Really pleased for DK getting his game going. It sets us up for the rest of the tournament. Games get won at lost at the No. 7 and 8 position with the Impact subs, so he's key. Our plan at the auction was to find the DNA of the team.

RCB's record hasn't been great but that wasn't an issue tonight. The biggest event seemed to have taken place at the start of the chase, when Bairstow dropped Kohli. It unleashed one of the best players, and indeed flayers, in cricket. Him charging pacers and clubbing them through extra is what we've imagined doing as kids. The overseas stars failed. Promoting Green to No. 3 and Patidar over Maxwell didn't work. Harpreet was sensational, Rabada was good too.

But when wickets start falling, you have to understand the conditions as well. The wicket wasn't as placid as normal here. It was a bit two-paced.

It unleashed one of the best players, and indeed flayers, in cricket. Him charging pacers and clubbing them through extra is what we've imagined doing as kids. The overseas stars failed. Promoting Green to No. 3 and Patidar over Maxwell didn't work. Harpreet was sensational, Rabada was good too.
