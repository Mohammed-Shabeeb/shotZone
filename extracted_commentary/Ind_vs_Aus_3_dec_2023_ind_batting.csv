He also has a chance at a run out at the non-striker's end but misses again","Dwarshuis to Suryakumar Yadav, 1 run, dropped, run-out missed? It's all happening for Australia. SKY sliced the drive to the right of McDermott at backward point. It was a tough chance, but McDermott did well to time his jump and stick his right hand out while at it. Unfortunately for Australia, the ball didn't stick and the rebound fell a bit too far out of his reach. What's more?
